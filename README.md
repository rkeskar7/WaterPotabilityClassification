# WaterPotabilityClassification

This model is a classification model built using Pythonâ€™s TensorFlow library along with the keras API, and utilizes basic classification techniques to classify water as either potable (1) or not potable (0), given the pH level and other measures. 

The dataset used here was obtained from Kaggle under the Creative Commons Public Domain: https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability?select=water_potability.csv

 
To run this code locally, download the program along with the csv file from the above Kaggle link, open the program in a terminal window, and run the file using python3 water_potability_classification.py
